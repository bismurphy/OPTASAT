# OPTASAT

This is the repository for OPTASAT, the Open-source Python Tool for Awareness of Spacecraft and Analysis of Telemetry.

OPTASAT is my PhD work, and will be presented at Small Sat on Aug 8, 2024.

The software will be released on this repository soon, pending approval by the relevant parties at MIT. This is expected within 1 week.

Please feel free to start a discussion in the Discussions tab of this repository if you have any questions about OPTASAT. Thank you for your interest!
